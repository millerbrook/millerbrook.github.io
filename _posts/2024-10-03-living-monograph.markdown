Last year I published [Narrativity in Cognition](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-40349-1), which engages recent findings in psychology and neuroscience to offer a process-oriented model of cognitive narratology.

Research in these fields advances at a rapid pace, and scholarship that engages the book makes fair points about precision and accuracy in the model.

So, I propose to use this blog to model a monograph that accumulates feedback and is revised over time.

I have two goals: first, to invite change into the model; second, to present the model both simply and in detail. 

To invite change, I plan to record perspectives on the model that elicit scrutiny and possible alteration. Also, I plan to introduce overlooked and new research that invites altering the model.

To present the model both simply and in detail, I plan to employ a nested approach to presenting the contents of the model.
